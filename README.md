#Waboot EU Taxation for WooCommerce

This plugin adds the fields for fiscal code and VAT number among the WooCommerce billing fields.

During the checkout an additional field allows the customer to specify if he\she is buying as private individuals or in behalf of a company, and if the VAT number (not required in the first case) is VIES valid, then the system will calculate the taxation accordingly.

The system will also validate VAT numbers and fiscal codes.
